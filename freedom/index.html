            <p> Electrical engineers are engineers that work with anything electrical. They can be found in any part of projects that involve electrical circuits. Electrical engineers can design, innovate, test, install, and supervise any project. They use software to design and create circuits to help develop and improve existing projects. Some electrical engineers do different things, some manufacture circuit components and some test the circuits and see if they can do basic code. Electrical engineers are needed in most projects making them an asset in most things.
