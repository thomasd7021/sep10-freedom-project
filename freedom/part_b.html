            <p>My first idea is and upgraded outlet. It would cover itself when not in use. It would also be safe for babies. It would help with people that forget to put outlet covers back on after use</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>My second idea is a scanner. It would scan product to make sure they are safe. It would check for radiation and lastability of products and would check to make sure the product works.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>My third idea is a Self Wiring wire. It would connect 2 wires together automatically and would be able to automatically cut wires to make them fit in the space that is needed</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>My last and favorite idea is a hologram circit. This would project the circuit into the real would to see if it fits. It would run a simulation to see if the circuit can run properly in the space. It also gives a visual aid to the engineer and makes it easter to create better circuits</p>
